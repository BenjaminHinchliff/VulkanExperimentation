# VulkanExperimentation
I didn't realize going into this that Vulkan needs like 1000 lines of boilerplate code (well 900 actually). This is going to be very fun.

## Compilation/Usage
use cmake to convert it into a native project and just compile it from there. Depends on the Vulkan SDK being installed from the system and that the `VULKAN_SDK` environment variable is defined.
