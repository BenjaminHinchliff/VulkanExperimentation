# VulkanExperimentation
I didn't realize going into this that Vulkan needs like 1000 lines of boilerplate code (well 900 actually). This is going to be very fun.

## Running
Umm... good luck with that - depends on vcpkg installed glfw and Vulkan. Later on I plan to add glfw as a subrepository, but haven't gotten round to it yet
