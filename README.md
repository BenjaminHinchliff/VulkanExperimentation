# VulkanExperimentation
I didn't realize going into this that Vulkan needs like 1000 lines of boilerplate code (well 900 actually). This is going to be very fun.

## Running
Umm... good luck with that - depends on vcpkg installed glfw and Vulkan from LunarG. Later on I plan to add glfw as a subrepository, but haven't gotten round to it yet.

It _should_ work on Linux and Mac but I haven't tested it, so make sure you know how to debug this stuff just in case.
